        <p><strong>Welcome to my world :)</strong> </p>

        <p>I'm Zihui Dong from China, and this is my 1st year and 1st semester to study in RMIT. I'm interested in handmade stuff and various paintings from different fields. I'm also a pop-music lover, I like to know the background concept of a music or its mv, that I can get some inspirations for my future designs. All of my current projects are going to present in this website, and I will share my process in here. I will also reflect on how I felt when I created the project and how I came from different views.</p>

        <h5><ins>Artist Statement 1</ins></h5>
        
        <p>
         1st project is a 2min re-editing from the video and the audio. The video and the audio were supported by resources from a file, finally, I choose "New Town" as my original virtual video, and "This is Marshall McLuhan: The Medium is the Message " as my audio resource. To create a better video, I also used "Free sound" and "YouTube Music" to support the audio. 
        
         <br><br>
         The main idea of my video is the character discovered that there were some people who produced some polluted air in the community he lives, which cause the whole city to be living in a harmful environment. The character decided to have a meeting with the top managers from this community, then, they proposed a solution that put those people to do some contributive jobs, to establish a utopian community.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong><mark>Relationship between the sonic and visual componets</mark> </strong></p>
        <p>
            The emotional tone for the further sequence is expressed as the peace and the joy of resolving the issue. The editing of the video is going to display the process of the solution.
            <br><br>
            Sound effects and voice over are to further promote the development of the whole event so that the audience more clearly knows the cause and result of the issue. The main reason to set voice over, background music and sound effects is to present the whole story more completely, and make it interesting and appealing to audience. 
            <br><br>
            For a part of the video the tempo is going to be flash, to push the development of the issue. To express the tempo, the audio will use a high-speed sound effect. 
            <br><br>
            E.g. A vision shows that the character finds an idea for the solution, and the audio will be a sound effect "Ding!", as the solution comes out from his brain. Then, the shot moves to a fast-driving car crossing over the frame, the audio for this is a flash-driving vehicle sound effect.

        <p><strong><mark>Footage</mark></strong></p>
        <p>
            I chose 'New Town' as the video material for the visual editing project. 'New Town' is the only animation video resource among these five video projects. The exaggeration of every frame in this video is what attracts me most.
            <br><br>
            "This is Marshall McLuhan: The Medium is the Message " as my audio resource for voice over audio, to create a fluent story line. "Free sound" and "YouTube Music" are applied on the video as sound effects, the aim is to attract audience attention. 
        </p>

        <p><strong><mark>Power of sound</mark></strong></p>
        <p>
            During the process of establishing the video project, I found that sound and visual image go hand in hand. Sound evokes a reaction within us, and can genuinely make us feel better or worse, that audience can feel the emotion spread from the video. 
            <br><br>
            In my project, voice over is pushing the progress of the story, to build the characteristic of the role. The Sound effects appear in my video is to highlight the timing of the movement to capture the audience's attention. The whole story revolves around the protagonist solving the pollution problem in the town. In order to highlight how he solved the issue, the special effects can make the audience feel that he was troubled by the pollution problem at the beginning, and then the happiness after solving the problem.
        </p>

        <p><strong><mark>Video Rhythm</mark></strong></p>
        <p>
            In the project, the rhythm of the video is very important. An appropriate rhythm can help the audience better understand the story of the video. In the process of editing the video, the picture and sound should be stuck at just the right time, so as not to feel disjointed while watching.
            <br><br>
            For example, in a shot of my video, there is a car driving through the shot, so the sound effect of the car driving quickly and the car in the picture should be edited at the same time, and the special effect sound will also end at the same time after the sequence of the car ends.
        </p>

        <p><strong><mark>Theme,Concept,Genre</mark></strong></p>
        <p>
            The theme of my video is conducted from the original video “New Town”, the community is suffering harmful pollution from the strangers, but the main character solved the problem with the community's managers. The concept of the video is telling a completely story to audience, with a relax background music as a narrative video. 
        </p>

        <p><strong><mark>Primary Aesthetic</mark></strong></p>
        <p>
            Cartoon style is the primary aesthetic choices that attracted me, and the tone of the story is cool colour, that I put some sound effects to display the highly contrast between the visual image and the video.

        <p>
         The theme of my 2nd project is “Growth”, and I created 9 icons related to the topic. To illustrate better effect of icons, I designed a website to display these 9 icons and set sound effect for each icon. Users can click the icon, when the website open, and the sound will automatically play. Sound effect of each icon is very special, so that users can directly associate this icon after hearing the sound.
        
         <br><br>
         According to my 9 icons, I brainstormed some key words that associated with “Growth”, not only animals and human, also natural world. Growth can represent a lot in our lives, and this word provides me many ideas to produce icons. 
            
        </p>

        <div class="row">       
            <div class="image-container"><img id="egg" src="img/butterfly.png" width="200" height="200"/></div>
            <div class="image-container"><img id="butterfly" src="img/book.png" width="250" height="380"/></div>
            <div class="image-container"><img id="cake" src="img/whale.png" width="180" height="200"/></div>
            
        </div>

        <p><strong><mark>Theme</mark></strong></p>
        <p>
            Project 2 is a website design, and my 9 icons relate to the theme of Growth. “Growth” is a natural law, it reminded me of a series of word and images associated with growing up. Animals and plants are my original ideas, also various words stand for “Growth” that I wanted my icons can be presented. 
            <br>
            “Legacy” was my 1st choice to produce my icons and web page I wanted to create, however, the ideas of legacy I listed were hard to present from the images. “Growth” could stand for number of changes, not only people, also the issue that occur in everyone’s life. Natural creatures are my secondary ideas to present the theme of “Growth” which differs from traditional thinking.
        </p>

        <p><strong><mark>Previous Consideration</mark></strong></p>
        <p>
            Before I have created the final series of icons, there are several designs I produced to present the theme of growth. Firstly, I came up with some ideas that relate to my 9 key words, for each key word, I shaped 5 different designs. Therefore, I picked 9 designs from 45 icons which are mostly present the theme “Growth”, and those final 9 icons have some relation as a series.
        </p>

        <p><strong><mark>Thumbnail Sketches</mark></strong></p>
        <p>
            My thumbnail sketches were draw by procreate, then I exported as PNG format to illustrator. Pen tool is the most effective tool to illustrate 9 icons. During the illustration process, I replaced the original parts that looked complicated with more concise drawings, and I tried to make these designs into a series icon.
        </p>

        <div class="row">       
            <div class="image-container"><img id="egg" src="img/Thumbnail.png" width="200" height="200"/></div>
            
        </div>

        <p><strong><mark>Colour</mark></strong></p>
        <p>
            Based on the theme of Website is growing, I chose some colours related to the theme, such as green, yellow and blue, as my main colors and developed them into different tone. I used illustrator to put these colors on icons and adjusted how the icons looked in contrasting tone. A series of relatively close tonal to be put on the design finally.
        </p>

        <p><strong><mark>Element and Principles of sound</mark></strong></p>
        <p>
            To cooperate with my icons, the audio should be consistent with the icon, so that users will not feel strange when they click the icon. The most important thing is that the audio represents the icon, that users can associate with the icon when they hear the sound, this is what I think a successful web design should have.
            <br><br>
            E.g. One of my icons is a baby footprint then become adults footstep, therefore, a sound track of baby stepping change to stead adult walking.)

        <p><strong><mark>Translation of an abstract idea to a set of concrete visual design</mark></strong></p>
        <p>
            In my abstract concept, express my ideas in detailed words, which can make me more efficient in graphic design. A series of concrete visual designs is supported within a clearly defined thinking.

        <h4> Assignnment 3 Virtual Environment</h4>

        <p><strong>Artist Statement 3</strong></p>
        <p>
         The 3rd project is a virtual environment, which is based on my personal experience. The 3D environment is a camping space, and there is a transformation beside the edge of one of tents. The 1st environment is very similar to the camp that I experienced when I was in high school, that was cool, dark at night, and quiet. 
        
         <br><br>
         The 2nd environment is the interior design of the tent which has a huge difference from the tent I lived in at that time because I want to create a warm space that can support a good memory for campers. It was the hardest and most special challenge for me, so I choose this environment to establish my 3rd assignment for the 3D environment. To have a better understanding of the traveling pathway of my environment, I recorded a short video to show users how can they travel around this space.

        </p>

        <p><strong><mark>Prototype</mark></strong></p>
        <p>
            Prototype provides a true test of my design and its intended function, and also can check the potential problem of during the design process. Technical problems appeared in different stage when I was prototyping, it allows me to detect problems in the building environment and correct them. I also have a more intuitive view of what the environment I'm building looks like.
        </p>

        <div class="row">       
            <div class="image-container"><img id="egg" src="img/daytime.PNG" width="200" height="200"/></div>

        <p><strong><mark>3D VS 2D</mark></strong></p>
        <p>
            When designing and building a 3D environment, you need to look at the model from various perspective. It should be as close to real life as possible and it has a relatively clear proportion, that the creator can build the environment more efficiently. 2D projects are more of a flat design, which only requires users to understand my design from a specified perspective, and the designer doesn’t need to adjust the object in different sizes. I think 3D projects give users more interests and give them a sense of being there.
        </p>

        <div class="row">       
            <div class="image-container"><img id="egg" src="img/flat1.jpg" width="200" height="200"/></div>

        </div>

        <p><strong><mark>Virtual Camera</mark></strong></p>
        <p>
            The virtual camera in my 3D project was playing a significant role, it allowed me to look the environment from different angles from the main camera. To have a better observation with the character to travel through the environment, there is a camera follow with the character. What the camera in Assignment 1 and 3 have in common is that they look at the surroundings from different angles. However, the perspective of homework 3 is fixed, so it cannot shoot the surrounding scenery alone, and it must be shot on the basis of what the characters can observe.
        </p>

        <p><strong><mark>Sound in 3D Environment</mark></strong></p>
        <p>
            In this project, I added some special effects and looped atmosphere sounds to create the camping atmosphere I wanted. Unlike assignments 1 and 2, in both cases the sound was not looped; it was played at a specific point and then ended. Sound effects for each of my projects are important, that the users could attracted by those sounds, and understand the meaning the producer want to spread.
        </p>

        <p><strong><mark>Element in my virtual environment</mark></strong></p>
        <p>
            In my virtual camping environment, the main first environment is made up of various elements of natural and filed, that could cooperate with the theme of camping. With the development of building the virtual environment project, the theme of camping changed from a quiet and peaceful environment to a warm and comfortable room. 
            My original concept was creating a cold and hard place for camper, it based on my camping experience when I was 17. However, the elements I added on my 3D environment change the atmosphere of the project. Therefore, the final project is a peaceful and dark virtual camping environment, and transfer to a warm and lightning room.
        </p>

        <p><strong><mark>Play Testing</mark></strong></p>
        <p>
            In the process of game testing, I found that the perspective of the protagonist needed to use the mouse arrow to switch the perspective, and the protagonist's walking speed was very fast, it was difficult to adjust his moving speed. In terms of sound, I found that some special effects sound needed to be looped to represent the atmosphere of the scene.
